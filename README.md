# BarthX – Chemical CO₂ Reducer for Automotive Applications
🚗 Project Overview

BarthX is an innovative initiative aimed at developing a chemical reducer device for automobiles. Its purpose is to optimize the capture of CO₂ emissions from vehicles, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation sector.

This project explores how chemical reduction mechanisms can be integrated into car exhaust systems to trap carbon dioxide more efficiently, reducing the overall environmental footprint of road transport.

🌍 Motivation

The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to CO₂ emissions worldwide.
BarthX addresses this challenge by proposing a solution that:

Enhances CO₂ capture directly at the source

Supports global decarbonization goals

Improves the ecological performance of traditional combustion vehicles

Offers a transitional solution while electric mobility continues to expand

# How It Works (Concept)

The project investigates the potential of a chemical reduction system, placed within the vehicle’s exhaust pathway, to:

React with CO₂ emissions

Reduce or trap carbon molecules

Store or convert them into less harmful compounds

Detailed diagrams and chemical pathways will be added as development progresses.

# Objectives

Design a compact, efficient chemical reducer for automotive use

Test chemical reactions suitable for CO₂ capture in high-temperature environments

Evaluate performance through controlled experiments

Explore scalability and potential industrial applications
